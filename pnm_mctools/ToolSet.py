    An outflow pore is not integrated and not divergence free. The value in the affected
    pore is averaged from the connected pores, weighted by the respective fluxes.

    diffusive contributions require this averaged value to work properly.

    of reverse flow the behavior is undefinend.

    Parameters

    bc: list/dict
        Boundary conditions in the form of a dictionary, where each label is associated with a certain type of BC

        determines the component ID that the boundary condition is associated with
    A: matrix
        [Np, Np] Matrix to be manipulated, if 'None' is provided this will skipped
    x: array_like
        [Np, 1] numpy array with initial guess
    b: array_like
        [Np, 1] numpy array with rhs values
    type: str
        specifies the type of manipulation, especially for the prescribed value the enforcement differs between

    Returns
    -------
    Return depends on the provided data, if A and b are not 'None', both are returned. Otherwise either A or b are returned.

    Notes
    -----
    Currently supported boundary conditions are:
        'noflow'     - not manipulation required
        'prescribed' - prescribes a value in the specified pore
        'value'      - alias for 'prescribed'
        'rate'       - adds a rate value to the pore
        'outflow'    - labels pore as outflow and interpolates value from connected pores

    The boundary conditions have to be provided by means of a list where each position in the list is associated with a
    component in the system. Each element in the list has to be a dictionary, where the key refers to the label of pores
    that the boundary condition is associated with. The value of the dictionary is again a dictionary with the type of
    boundary condition and the value.
    For single components, only the dictionary may be given as input parameter
    A code example:

    # The system of DGLs models 3 components and the network has two boundary regions 'inlet' and 'outlet'
    Nc = 3
    bc = [{}] * Nc
    bc[0]['inlet']  = {'prescribed': 1.}     # Component 0 has a prescribed value at the inlet with the value 1
    bc[0]['outlet'] = {'outflow'}            # at the outlet the species is allowed to leave the system (technically a set, any provided value will either way be ignored)
    bc[1]['inlet']  = {'rate': 0.1}          # Component 1 has an inflow rate with value 0.1
    bc[1]['outlet'] = {'outflow'}            # Component 1 is also allowed to leave the system
    bc[2]['inlet']  = {'noflow'}             # Component 2 is not allowed to enter of leave the system, technically this is not required to specify but the verbosity helps to address setup errors early on
    bc[2]['outlet'] = {'noflow'}             # Component 2 may also not leave at the outlet, e.g. because it's adsorbed to the surface

class MulticomponentTools:
    r"""
    Object with convenient methods for developing multicomponent transport models with OpenPNM pore networks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network: OpenPNM network
        network with the geometrical information
    num_components: int
        number of components that shall be modelled with this toolset
    bc: list
        list of boundary conditions for each component. May be 'None', then no
        boundary conditions will be applied

    Notes
    -----

    A multicomponent model is expected to adhere to the conservation law:
    \[f
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\phi + \nabla \cdot J - S = 0
    \]
    with the extensive variable $\phi$, time $t$, flux $J$ and source $S$. This toolset provides convenient
    functions to compute gradients, divergences, time derivatives and fluxes. In the case of multiple coupled
    components, the matrix is organized block-wise so the rows of coupled components computed at a single node
    (or pore respectively) are located adjacent to each other.
    Note, that here the term 'divergence' is used, although contemporary literature employs sums and references
    Kirchhoff's law. For simplicity, this notation is dropped and only 'divergence' used.

        The direction of the fluxes is directly linked with the storage of the connections
        inside the OpenPNM network. For more details, refer to the 'create_incidence_matrix' method
        of the network module.
        The resulting matrix IS NOT SCALED with the fluxes and can also be used for determining
        upwind interpolated values.
        The provided fluxes can either be:
            int/float - single value
            list/numpy.ndarray - with size num_components applies the values to each component separately
            numpy.ndarray - with size Nt applies the fluxes to each component by throat: great for convection
            numpy.ndarray - with size Nt * num_components is the most specific application for complex
                            multicomponent coupling, where fluxes can be opposed to each other within
